### Project Title
Project: Linear Regression(Codecademy PRO test)

### Description
Linear Regression is when you have a group of points on a graph, and you find a line that approximately resembles that group of points. A good Linear Regression algorithm minimizes the error_, or the distance from each point to the line. A line with the least error is the line that fits the data the best. We call this a line of best fit.

We will use loops, lists, and arithmetic to create a function that will find a line of best fit when given a set of data.

### Files used
